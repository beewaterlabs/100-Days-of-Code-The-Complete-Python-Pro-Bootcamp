# Even numbers: % 2 == 0 (even number / 2 divides evenly every time... Of course)
# Modulo Operator % (only shows the remainder)

# This will take the number you input and turn it from a str ("string") to an int (whole number)
# Test this by un-commenting & running the following code:
    # print(type(int(input("Whats the number you want to check?"))))    [int]
    # print(type(input("Whats the number you want to check?")))         [str]

number_to_check = int(input("What's the number you want to check?"))

if number_to_check % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
else:
    print("Odd!")
