Advanced Configuration
The Homebrew installer offers various advanced configuration settings. Most users can skip this section and instead follow the instructions on the homepage!

Git Remote Mirroring
If you have issues connecting to GitHub.com, you can use Git mirrors for Homebrewâ€™s installation and brew update by setting HOMEBREW_BREW_GIT_REMOTE and/or HOMEBREW_CORE_GIT_REMOTE in your shell environment with this script:

export HOMEBREW_BREW_GIT_REMOTE="..."  # put your Git mirror of Homebrew/brew here
export HOMEBREW_CORE_GIT_REMOTE="..."  # put your Git mirror of Homebrew/homebrew-core here
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
The default Git remote will be used if the corresponding environment variable is unset and works best for most users.

Note: if you set these variables you are granting these repositories the same level of trust you currently grant to Homebrew itself. You should be extremely confident that these repositories will not be compromised.
